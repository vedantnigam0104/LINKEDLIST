MOST OF US DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PRINT A REVERSE LINKED LIST .SO HERE IT IS I HAVE PRINTED A REVERSE LINKED LIST IN THE MOST EASIEST WAY POSSIBLE.I HAVE JUST USED A POINTER 
VARIABLE TO TRAVERSE THE LIST FROM THE LAST NODE OF THE LIST.THIS WAY HELPED ME TO PRINT THE LINKED LIST IN REVERSE ORDER AND HENCE MADE MY TASK EASIER.I HOPE THAT YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS CODE AND IT WILL HELP YOU IN UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF LINKED LIST.THANK YOU!
